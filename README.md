## Installation

Choose which type of web browser extension you want to use to install **Block YouTube Shorts** styles:

- [Via **user style manager** extension](#via-user-style-manager-extension)
- [Via **ad blocker** extension](#via-ad-blocker-extension)


#### Via user style manager extension 

<small>_* This alternative doesn't involve blocking ads_</small>

User style manager is a web browser extension for changing the look and feel of web pages. 
You need a user style manager extension that supports installing UserCSS, I recommend Stylus extension.

1. If you don't already have an style manager extension, install **Stylus** for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/).

2. Open **Block YouTube Shorts** UserCSS installation tab by clicking in below button:

    [![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_with-Stylus-238b8b)](https://github.com/mumvock/block-youtube-shorts/raw/master/block-youtube-shorts.user.css)

3. In the newly opened tab, click in **Install style** button <small>(upper left corner)</small>.

4. Enjoy YouTube without Shorts.


#### Via ad blocker extension

Ad blocker is a web browser extension for blocking or altering online advertising.
You need a ad blocker extension that supports installing custom CSS filters, I recommend uBlock Origin extension.

1. If you don't already have an ad blocker extension, install **uBlock Origin** for [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/) or [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak).

2. Open Ublock Origin by clicking on its icon.

3. Open the Ublock dashboard by clicking in the `gears` button.

4. In the newly opened tab, go to `Filter Lists` tab.

5. Scroll to the page's bottom and click in `Import` option.

6. Paste the following URL:

    `https://github.com/mumvock/block-youtube-shorts/blob/master/block-youtube-shorts.list.txt`
